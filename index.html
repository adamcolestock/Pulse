                        <p> The shifting shapes are derivations/extractions of
                            longitude and latitude coordinates from a stretch of the New Jersey Shoreline at Cape May.
                            The
                            numerical information is separated into a series of xy coordinates in P5 as corresponding
                            abstract shapes, rather than visualized as a linear segment of a shoreline. </p>

        <p> One contour classified as "URBAN" and one contour classified as "WETLANDS" forming the coastline of New
            Jersey are selected at random and placed on the canvas above their category label. The contours slowly flow
            and blend together forming a continuous non-binary abstract form suggesting that simple category labels
            might limit human thinking about the relationship between the natural and the built environment along our
            coasts. </p>
        <p> See the about page for more information about the dataset that was used. </p>
        <p> This piece was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwSrTICsG2I">this video</a> that led me
            to think about how, in a time in which climate change is leading to dangerously shifting coastlines, we
            might need to question our assumptions about the strategies and benefits of 'softening' vs. 'hardening' our
            coastlines to 'defend' against natural forces </p>
